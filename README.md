# Sudoku Solver
Written in Typescript

## In Progress
- ~~convert validateBoard() to create array representation of board instead of pulling values directly from DOM~~
- ~~have potentialValues() update board representation~~
- include grid search when finding potential values
- call ^ recursively to solve only one possibility until no updates
- implement backtracking algorithm for non-deterministically solvable values
