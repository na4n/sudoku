# Sudoku Solver
Written in Typescript

## In Progress
- ~~convert validateBoard() to create array representation of board instead of pulling values directly from DOM~~
- ~~have potentialValues() update board representation~~
- ~~include grid search when finding potential values~~
- ~~call ^ recursively to solve only one possibility until no updates~~
- implement backtracking algorithm for non-deterministically solvable values
- check for edge cases where deterministic solutions and backtracking do not solve
- include and automate test suite for different boards... very very hard to find test cases
